# FitLeaf

## Description
FitLeaf is a web application built with React and Express.js. It provides a platform for users to engage in various physical activities with challenges and timers. Users can attempt challenges and complete a specified number of repetitions within the given time frame.

## Getting Started

To get started with FitLeaf, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js and npm**: If you don't have Node.js and npm installed, download and install them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the project folder.
   ```
   cd FitLeaf
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies for the React frontend. Run the following command inside the project's root folder.
   ```
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies for the Express.js backend. In the project's root folder, run:
   ```
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Web App
To run FitLeaf, follow these steps:

1. Start the Express.js server. In the project's root folder, run:
   ```
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the React development server. In the project's root folder, run:
   ```
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

This will start the development server for the frontend and the Express.js server for the backend.
